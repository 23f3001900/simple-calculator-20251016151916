Wait, the user said "fix layout issues." So the original might have buttons not properly aligned, maybe the equals button was shorter than others. In the new layout, using a grid with each button of equal size. Maybe 4x4 grid with a 5th column for the equals to span columns if needed. Let me think. Typically a calculator has buttons arranged in rows: 1-2-3, 4-5-6, 7-8-9, 0 and equals. So a grid of 4 rows and 4 columns, with some buttons spanning two columns.

Also, accessibilityâ€”ensure that the buttons have proper labels and can be navigated via keyboard, but since it's a one-file solution, maybe skip that unless required. Focus on UI improvements as per the brief.

Testing each part step by step: create the HTML elements, apply styles, add event listeners, and test functionality. Make sure all buttons are clickable and perform their roles. The display should update correctly when buttons are pressed.

Finally, review the code for any errors, check responsiveness on different screen sizes, and ensure the UI is polished with transitions and hover effects.
